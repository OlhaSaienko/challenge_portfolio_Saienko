# Task 1: Software configuration
Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I decided to participate in the project because I like testing and programming, but experience and knowledge are not enough. I want to develop, I am sure that the project will open up a lot of new and useful things for me to achieve my goal, to work in this area! I hope to work fruitfully in a team and not only gain knowledge, but also share my own). 
Good luck to each of us!
